# Toolkit for Practising System Thinking

## Purpose

To help engineers practice __responsible system thinking__ through a simple and fun role\-playing/simulation game in which they must work together to complete a “successful” project\. Note: We are not asking you to create a real robot obviously\!

## Game description

Name: “Engineers Village”

A simple role\-playing game in which players will take on the role of engineers who handle different systems as part of a complex robotics project in which they will have to work together with one another to deliver an intelligent machine to solve the problems of people at the neighbouring village\. They must think about the resource constraints and how one team’s work could affect the performance of the others as well as the environment and discuss the best possible way to complete the project\.

## Premise or background story of the game

The Engineers’ Village is known to be the home of very creative and hardworking engineers who are very eager to help people from neighbouring villages with their problems through intelligent machines or robots\. Engineers are divided into those who oversee the __*software and database development*__, __*mechanical design and manufacture*__, __*electronics and telecommunication*__, and __*materials and metallurgy*__\.

Village A is the client of the engineers in this game\. The village doesn’t have enough farmers to cope with the increasing demand for food production in the village and they came to the Engineers’ Village for help to solve their farming problem\. The players of this game, who act as the engineers, are planning to manufacture autonomous farming robots to make the farming process in Village A\.

Your job as the engineers are to work together to make the best possible use of available resources \(diamonds\) in Engineers’ Village and ensure that your project does not exceed the limit of the environmental impact points and ensure that every engineer maintains or increase their performance points so that the project can be considered successful\.

## How the game works

### Core Rules
- There is __a total of only 20 diamonds__ for the whole project that __must be shared__ among all the engineers \(players\) and it is up to all the players how to share the diamonds that each of them will need to do their job\.
- There is an initial __5\-performance points__ for each engineer that they need to maintain or increase for the project to be considered __successful__\. At the end of the players’ discussion, the total performance points of all engineers should be __at least 18__\. The higher the total performance points, the better the robot performance, hence the project becomes more impactful and successful.
- There is __a total of maximum 10 environment\-impact points__ that the players/engineers can accumulate\. At the end of the players’ discussion, the __total of their environment impact points cannot be more than 10 points no matter what__\.
- If there are extra or remaining diamonds, player can exchange it for more performance points per diamonds\.
- The criteria that they have to satisfy in order for their project to be given a green light:
     - Total number of __diamonds__ for the whole project that can be used is __20 diamonds__\.
     - Total number of __performance points__ should be __at least 18__\.
     - Total number of __environment-impact__ points __cannot be more than 10__\.

### Relationship between player roles

### Discussions between players

During the game, the players discuss and explain the engineering choices (card choice) that they would want to make for their respective team and discuss how they can distribute the resources (diamonds) between one another as needed while considering how their work affect one another\. After making their choices, they then discuss the consequences of the engineering choices they have made together and whether they can improve their project solution within the given constraints.

## What the players will learn
- They will learn that their work, as engineers, would always affect another engineering department/team and that they would have to think systematically when making engineering choices to deliver solutions for a successful project.
- They will also learn that their work are always constrained due to limited resources, how the engineering choices made in one department could affect another, and they also have to think about the environmental impact of their work.
